According to VS Memorandum No. 555.16, a weak positive EIA serum sample is available from the National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL).  The NVSL EIA serum sample is intended to remind approved personnel of the expected weak positive precipitation lines obtained in an agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID) test.  This serum sample does not represent a weak positive threshold sample as the sample has a higher antibody concentration.  If manufacturers wish to evaluate the NVSL EIA serum, they may purchase the sample from the NVSL.  The NVSL EIA serum sample is not intended to be used by manufacturers of AGID Equine Infectious Anemia Virus Antibody Test Kits during the standardization of the antigen in individual serials.  The Center for Veterinary Biologics-Policy, Evaluation, and Licensing (CVB-PEL) has available the current EIA weak positive threshold serum that manufacturers should use for antigen standardization of each AGID serial.  The EIA threshold serum is available to manufacturers upon request to the CVB-PEL.   /s/ Richard E. Hill, Jr.  Richard E.
