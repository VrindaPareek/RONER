Currently, 3-year immunogenicity testing of Master Seeds is required in 9 CFR113.66(b)(6), 113.67(b)(7), 113.68(b)(6), 113.69(b)(6), 113.70(b)(5), 113.71(b)(4),113.302(c)(4), 113.303(c)(6), 113.304(c)(4), 113.305(b)(1)(iii), 113.305(b)(2)(iii),113.306(b)(4), 113.308(b)(5), 113.309(c)(9), 113.310(c)(8), 113.311(c)(7),113.312(b)(5), 113.313(c)(6), 113.314(c)(4), 113.315(c)(4), 113.316(b)(5),113.317(c)(4), 113.318(b)(4), 113.325(c)(5), 113.326(c)(5), 113.327(c)(4), 113.328(c)(6),113.329(c)(5), 113.331(c)(4), and 113.332(c)(4).The CVB will allow exemptions to these testing requirements until the regulations arerevised.
