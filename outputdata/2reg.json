PURPOSEThe purpose of this notice is to inform all interested parties of the disposition of the commentswe received in response to the Federal Register notice of availability and request forcomments on a draft guideline titled, \u201cGood Clinical Practices\u201d (VICH GL9) developed by theInternational Cooperation on Harmonization of Technical Requirements for VeterinaryMedicinal Products (VICH).  Veterinary Services has issued the final guideline for Good Clinical Practice as VeterinaryServices Memorandum 800.301, which accompanies this notice.II. BACKGROUNDThe guideline was published in the Federal Register (64 FR 34764, Docket No. 99-045-1)on June 29, 1999.  Because the topic of the draft guideline concerns veterinary biologicalproducts, we requested comments on its provisions so that we could include any relevant inputon the draft to the VICH for its consideration to support the expertise available to the workinggroup preparing the final guideline.  III. COMMENTS AND DISPOSITIONWe received four sets of comments on the draft guideline.  One set of comments inquired if theguideline applied to in vitro diagnostic test kits, and provided some specific comments if theguideline were to be applied to these kits.  By definition, clinical studies are \u201cconducted in atarget species,\u201d therefore, in vitro diagnostics are outside the scope of this guideline, and thespecific comments were not addressed.Three sets of comments included some specific revisions to the draft guideline.  Thesesuggested revisions and their dispositions are as follows:APHIS - Protecting American AgricultureAn Equal Opportunity EmployerUnited StatesDepartment ofAgricultureMarketing andRegulatoryProgramsAnimal and PlantHealth InspectionServiceVeterinary ServicesCenter for VeterinaryBiologicsSuite 104510 South 17th StreetAmes, IA  50010(515) 232-5785FAX (515) 232-7120ARHIEDSection 1.1 (one comment):  It was suggested that the definition of \u201cadverse event\u201d be revisedto be compatible with that developed by the VICH 24 Working Group (Pharmacovigilance ofVeterinary Medical Products: Management of Adverse Event Reports).  We agree with this suggestion, and the guideline was revised to use their definition.Section 1.17 (one comment):  It was suggested that the definition of \u201cInvestigational VeterinaryProduct\u201d be revised from \u201cany pharmaceutical form\u201d to \u201cany biological or pharmaceuticalform\u201d.  This change has been made.Sections 1.26 and 4.1 (two comments each):  It was suggested that \u201cand is liable\u201d be deletedfrom the definition of \u201cSponsor\u201d in the phrase \u201ctakes responsibility and is liable\u201d.  Thesechanges have been made.Section 1.33 (one comment):  It was suggested that \u201cto effect physiological functions\u201d shouldread \u201cto affect physiological functions\u201d.  This change has been made.Section 2.7 (three comments):  It was suggested that the phrase \u201cof the relevant regulatoryauthorities\u201d be added after the phrase \u201cgood manufacturing practice\u201d in the first sentence, dueto the absence of a single, universally accepted definition of \u201cGood Manufacturing Practice\u201d,and in recognition of  product made in accordance with the manufacturing practices required bythe relevant regulatory authority.  This change has been made.   Section 3.13 (one comment):  It was suggested that an APHIS Form 2007 should be adequateto demonstrate evidence that the investigator has appropriate credentials for conductingstudies.  We agree that if the investigator is a permanent employee of the firm, an APHIS Form2007 is adequate.  No change was made to the document because it was agreed that this is anacceptable local interpretation.  Section 3.2.6 (one comment):  It was suggested, and we agreed, that the sponsor should benotified \u201cpromptly\u201d rather than \u201cimmediately\u201d of the occurrence of study protocol deviations.The change has been made.Section 3.2.13 (three comments):  One commentator suggested that the word \u201cmust\u201d bereplaced with the word \u201cshould\u201d in the sentence \u201c...owner\u2019s agent must receive relevant...\u201d.We agree.  The document is intended as a guideline, and is not a regulation.  Therefore, theword \u201cmust\u201d is inappropriate and has been changed to \u201cshould\u201d.  Two comments suggestedthat if the animal is owned by the sponsor, informed consent is unnecessary or implicit, and should not require documentation.  We agree, but studiesconducted using animals owned by a sponsor do not constitute clinical practice.  Therefore, thisguideline does not apply, and no further changes were made.      Section 4.2.7, 8.1.2, and 8.4.1 (one comment each):  It was suggested that the word \u201cmust\u201dbe replaced with \u201cshould\u201d.  These changes have been made (see rationale explained in 3.2.13).Center for Veterinary Biologics Notice 01-11 2ARCHIVEDSection 4.2.11 (one comment):  A request to clarify \u201cfinal and safe disposal of all studyanimals\u201d was made.  We attempted to clarify the intent by stating that the sponsor should\u201cEnsure the proper disposal of all study animals according to the applicable regulatoryrequirements.\u201d  We agree that most clinical studies will not require \u201cfinal and safe disposal\u201d ofthe study animals.Section 5.1 (one comment):  It was suggested that the monitor need not be trained in dataauditing procedures.  We agreed with the suggestion to delete the phrase, \u201cand data auditingprocedures.\u201d  Section 5.2.7 (one comment):  It was suggested that the phrase \u201cbias or be a part of\u201d, bedeleted from the first sentence, \u201cNot, in any way, bias or be a part of the record-keeping\u201d.We agreed this sentence needed clarification, and the sentence was revised to read \u201cNot, inany way, bias the data collection process or outcome of the study...\u201d.  Section 6.3.20.1 (one comment):  It was suggested that this section limit SOP\u2019s to thosespecific to the technical conduct of the study.  We agreed, and added the words\u201cstudy-specific\u201d to the sentence.Section 7.3.6.4 (one comment):  It was suggested that \u201ccomplete description\u201d be replaced with\u201csummary\u201d in the sentence \u201ca complete description of the disposal...\u201d.  We agreed with thesuggestion, and the change has been made.Section 8.1.3 (one comment):  It was suggested that this section be revised to include astatement to protect the sponsor\u2019s confidential business information.  We believe existingregulatory restrictions on the confidentiality of this information are sufficient.  No changes weremade.  In addition to the above comments suggesting substantive changes, several typographical errorswere brought to our attention, and have been corrected.  IV.  ADDITIONAL DISCUSSIONTwo general comments indicated that the intent of the VICH guideline may not be wellunderstood, and should be clarified.  Publication of the guideline is not meant to imply thatadherence to the document represents the only acceptable route to regulatory approval of aproduct.  Rather, it provides product manufacturers with relative assurance that favorable datacollected in accordance with the guidelines will be acceptable to all three regions participatingin the VICH process.  The guidelines are meant to be applied only to clinical studies.  APHIS interprets the term\u201cclinical studies\u201d to be those conducted in the context in which unlicensed product will be usedin what the APHIS has usually referred to as \u201cfield safety\u201d or \u201cfield efficacy\u201d studies.  Theanimals enrolled in these studies are client-owned animals, which are recruited by theCenter for Veterinary Biologics Notice 01-11 3AHIVEDinvestigator(s) within a veterinarian-client-patient relationship, and data are typically collectedfrom multiple sites.  The guideline does not apply to controlled studies conducted by companies or their contractorsto support efficacy, safety, lack of reversion to virulence, etc.  APHIS interprets the term\u201ccontrolled studies\u201d to be those conducted in a controlled environment, using animals that areowned by the manufacturer (or the contractor).  These types of studies will be covered byother applicable guidelines at such time as they are developed.  Interested parties will have theopportunity to comment on the documents prior to finalization and implementation.The document is intended to be a comprehensive guideline for any and all types of clinicalpractice studies, and while some points may not be commonly applicable to most veterinarybiologics studies, they may be an important consideration for others.  For example, theinformation requested in 6.3.11 through 6.3.12, detailing animal management, housing, andfeeds might not be relevant in a field safety trial for a conventional parenteral vaccine intendedfor use in feedlot cattle.  In this case, a simple statement indicating that animals receive normalhusbandry and care could be adequate.  However, in a double-masked field efficacy study fora plant-derived veterinary biological, which is intended for prolonged oral administration tofeedlot cattle, the information requested in these sections could be highly relevant.  We do notintend to use this guideline as a protocol \u201ccheck list\u201d, nor will we require excessivedocumentation for information in sections of the guideline that are not relevant.Finally, concerns were raised regarding access of the United States biologics industry to theVICH process.  We believe these concerns were addressed when the VICH SteeringCommittee adopted criteria for the acceptance of \u201cinterested parties,\u201d and granted this     status to individuals or groups which met certain criteria.  In addition, the VICH has initiated aprogram of public conferences, which provide an opportunity for the public to review progress and make comments on specific guidelines and on the VICH process ingeneral.  /s/ James E.
